## About This Project

Multi-Tenant Laravel Project with InertiaJS
This project is a Laravel application designed to achieve multiple objectives and tasks that contribute to providing a simple and efficient multi-tenant user experience. The project was implemented as follows:

1. Setting Up the Laravel Project and Configuring Multi-Tenancy
A Laravel project was created from scratch and configured to support multi-tenancy without using any multi-tenancy packages. User authentication was included, and InertiaJS was used to enhance the user experience.

2. Creating a Superadmin Dashboard
A simple dashboard was created to display all merchants and users associated with each merchant.

3. Creating a Merchant Dashboard
A simple dashboard was created to display all users associated with the current merchant.

4. Creating a User Dashboard
A simple dashboard was created to welcome the user.

5. Creating Seeders for Data
Seeders were created to populate initial data, including the creation of a super admin, 30 merchants, and 100 users for each merchant.

This project represents a first step in building a multi-tenant application in Laravel and can be extended and developed to meet the actual project requirements. If you have any questions or improvements you'd like to make, feel free to get in touch and contribute to the development of this project.
